Hello everyone
Thanks for helping me to gather data-set for my project.
Make sure your device has python 3.8 installed.
Here are the steps you will need to follow

1) We will create a virtual environment for this task. Once you have downloaded the repository, create a virtual environment in the folder containing the python file.
Use following steps to create a virtual environment.
	a) open command prompt/terminal
	b) change the directory containing the python file.
	c) to create virtual environment enter the following command
		"python -m venv venv" or "py -m venv venv"
	d) Now activate the viurtual environment using following command
		"venv\Scripts\activate"
	e) This will put (venv) before the directory in command line indicating virtual environment is activated

2) Now we will install opencv package required for this file.
Use the following command to install opencv
	"pip install opencv-pyhton"
NOTE: Latest python version (3.9.0) is currently not compatible with this command.

3) Now that everything is set, we can now run the main python script.
Use the following command to run the script
	"python tst.py"

4) Now all you need to do is Follow instructions given in the commandline from the script.
The window capturing image will show which gisture it is capturing and show the gesture in the capture window accordingly.

5) Once the script has compleated executing, it will create a folder with your name containing all the images. All you need to do is zip the folder and mail it to me via d2l or @ abhiraj@pdx.edu

6) I really appreciate your help.
